					<speaker>Mayor</speaker>
					<text>You and me both. He has such a huge influence in this town, and with how malleable everyone is right now because of The Update, he essentially has a cult behind him. People have been disappearing all throughout town since we've hit 40%.</text>
					<text>I think he's involved, but because him and Michael grew up together, there's no one for me to bring my concerns up to.</text>
					<text>I just with that.... what the hell?!</text>
