				<answer label="Some paper clips">
					<speaker>Alex</speaker>
					<text>I'll take one of those paper clips, I guess.</text>
					<speaker>Glenn</speaker>
					<text>Oooh good choice. It's made of premium... I dunno. Some sort of metal, I think. Iron is a main component since magnets work on it.</text>
					<text>That'll be 25 cents, my main man.</text>

				<answer label="Rubber band">
					<speaker>Alex</speaker>
					<text>That rubber band looks pretty nice.</text>
					<speaker>Glenn</speaker>
					<text>Aaaah, you have quite an eye. That particular rubber band probably belonged to Napoleon Bonapare at one point.</text>
					<text>He lost it at the battle of Waterloo, along with everything else his life had to offer.</text>
					<text>Ten cents.</text>

				<answer label="Medicine">
					<speaker>Alex</speaker>
					<text>I would like that medicine.</text>
					<speaker>Glenn</speaker>
					<text>Ah yes, the medicine. It doesn't have a name, but it has mutiple purposes. A staple in several video games.</text>
					<text>Because in computer land, all sicknesses can be cured using the same wonder-drug. I wonder how rich the guy is who invented this.</text>
					<text>I don't know why we even need doctors with this stuff always available.</text>
					<text>That'll run you about ten dollars.</text>
